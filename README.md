# acl2021-education
This repository contains the code for the ACL 2021 paper "Question Generation for Adaptive Education". 

Code for training and testing models is in the `./src` subdirectory. 
Code for replicating reported results and analysis, as well as additional analysis (described below), is in the `./results` subdirectory.
We also provide two scripts to easily play with a LMKT-student knowledge tracing model (`play_student_model.py`) and a question generation model (`play_qg_model.py`).
